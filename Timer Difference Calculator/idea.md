# Simple HTML/JS program that takes in two clock times to the nearest minute and returns a time difference in various formats.
## Input requirements
- time point 1 in the form hh:mm
- time point 2 in the form hh:mm
- the ':' should separate to text fill-ins, but when typing, it should automatically transfer the cursor into the next text input field,
  so 8 numbers can be typed on the keyboard without moving the mouse.
- The order of these two doesn't matter, but it should not accept the same time.
- A "Calculate" button works, but both a button and 'Enter' key is preferred to do the time difference calculation.

## Output types
- minutes
- hours (hours and minutes)
- days (decimal)

## Output requirements
- always a positive number for time difference

## App requirements
Should run completely locally in a browser window, even if no internet access.
