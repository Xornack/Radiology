Show radiology cases, which students review on their personal devices (would have be vendor agnostic, so maybe website would be best).
Then when they review the case, have option to anonymously vote or just move onto the answer. Then next case, next case...etc. Like a really
interactive case converence, where they get a chance to guess. Possibly even write-in answers.
