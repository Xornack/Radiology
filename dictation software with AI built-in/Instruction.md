# Potential project impetus
Our standard dictation software doesn't incorporate LLMs into the editing process. There are free, open source LLMs that could do this job.
In fact, our hospital actually provides one online that allows PHI. It's clunky to cut and paste into it, and read the output for editing.
Would be better if the software flagged potential errors and offered edits and possibly clickable rewording/rewriting in app.

# Desires
-Speed, both for the program and it's voice recognition is a must.
-Security. Deploying a program like this on a hospital computer needs to be incredibly secure.
-Modular for redability and feature upgrade potential.
-Prefer an OS neutral system, but must work in Windows.
-Has to send messages with HL7
-It PACS communication is possible, woulk like to get back the functionality of showing studies as priors if we open them in PACS.
