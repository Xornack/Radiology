# Heart Parser (Web)

A comprehensive web-based parser for cardiac MRI and TMVR measurement data, designed to convert raw cardiac imaging software output into standardized radiology report format.

## Features

### ðŸ«€ **TMVR Analysis**
- Parses 2D and 3D transcatheter mitral valve replacement measurements
- Extracts trigone-trigone distance, SL distance, IC distance, area, and perimeter
- Automatic area conversion from cmÂ² to sq mm
- Professional report formatting

### ðŸ“Š **LV/RV Function Analysis**
- Complete left and right ventricular function assessment
- Multi-line input format support (handles both inline and separated values)
- Gender-specific clinical assessments based on established reference ranges
- Parameters include:
  - End-diastolic volume (EDV) and indexed values (EDVI)
  - End-systolic volume (ESV) and indexed values (ESVI)
  - Stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF)
  - Myocardial mass and mass index

### ðŸ©¸ **Flow Quantification**
- Aortic and pulmonary artery flow analysis
- Forward/reverse volume measurements
- Regurgitant fraction calculations
- Peak velocity and pressure gradient assessments
- Automatic vessel type detection

### ðŸ§¬ **Clinical Intelligence**
- **Gender-specific normal values** based on established clinical studies
- **Comprehensive assessments**: normal, abnormal (low/high), mildly/moderately/severely depressed
- **Reference standards**: Kawel-Boehm JCMR 2015, Salton JACC 2002, Plein JMRI 2003

## Usage

1. **Open** `heart_parser_web.html` in any modern web browser
2. **Select patient gender** from the dropdown menu
3. **Paste** cardiac data into the input text area
4. **Choose processing type**:
   - **TMVR**: For transcatheter mitral valve replacement measurements
   - **LV/RV Function**: For ventricular function analysis
   - **Flow Measurement**: For aortic/pulmonary flow quantification
5. **Process**
6. **Copy or save** the formatted output

## Technical Features

- **Single HTML file**: No external dependencies, runs entirely in browser
- **Multi-line format support**: Handles various cardiac software output formats
- **Robust parsing**: Handles both inline and separated value formats
- **Clinical validation**: Assessments based on peer-reviewed reference studies
- **Data security**: All processing is local, no data transmission
- **Export functionality**: Copy to clipboard or save as text file
