# Purpose:
Convert output from a cardiac CT and MRI software package into a structured format suitable for radiology reports.

# Features:
- Extracts TMVR measurements, left and right ventricular volumes, relevant statistics, and aortic and pulmonary outflow measurements.
- References normal value ranges for select variables to categorize findings as normal or abnormal. If abnormal, provides grading (e.g., mild, moderate, severe dilation).
- Employs a rule-based approach for classification.
- Designed to run locally.
- Implemented using HTML and JavaScript, preferably as a single, self-contained HTML file.
