Open liver_iron_calculator.html in a browser and fill in the fields. If any R2* values are missing, the mean uses the available numbers and a warning appears. 
The magnetic field strength is selected from a drop‑down list enforcing 1.5 or 3.0.

After calculating, the results are displayed in a Bootstrap‑styled layout. The deployed project is here: https://liver-iron.static.domains/liver-iron-calculator.
