## Essential Questions for Your Machine Learning Project 
- **What problem are you trying to solve?**
- **Has this already been done before?** If so, are you trying to clone or improve upon a prior design?
- **How will you prevent the model from learning irrelevant information or information you don't want the model to learn?** If the project involves categorization, how will you control for learning correlated but ultimately irrelevant information? For example, the famous case of a model learning the marker on a radiograph rather than the disease process. Another example, learning a person's race, gender, presence of tube for free air...
- **What tools do you need for labeling?** If any, build these first, and make sure they're fast.
- **Can you make a minimal viable product to test and show?** Even if you need much more data to make it good. Do it right now, and make sure your idea is feasible.

## REMEMBER: Do the hard thing first.
- Monkeys juggling chainsaws on a pedestal. What good is the pedestal if you can never train the monkeys to juggle chainsaws?
- This means conceptually hard thing. The new, novel, or hard-to-conceptualize thing. Not data labeling. That isn't hard, it's just annoying.
